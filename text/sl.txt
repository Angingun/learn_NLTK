Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said on Monday that equality is a must in reaching a trade deal with the United States.
US President Donald Trump said on Monday in Japan that Washington isn't ready to strike a trade deal with China, but he's leaving open the possibility that the two nations could reach an agreement someday.
He predicted a "very good deal with China sometime into the future, because I don't believe that China can continue to pay these really hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs".
